1. function to loat the data (which we have)

2. func to normalize data (mean-based filter func) / data cleaning steps

3. Function to compute the pearson correlation coefficients. take 2 slices of floats as input and return float64. 

4. (CreateCorrelationMatrix) - function to compute the correlation matrix . take expressionmap (map of map of string to float, slice of gene names and sample) to return 2d array of floats

5. (CreateAdjacencyMatrix) - function to compute the Adjacency Matrix (CreateAdjacencyMatrix)
-take previos corr matrix (2d array of floats, and threshold, which represents min absolute correlation strength)

6. (BuildCoExpressionNetwork) - like Noemi said, this is highest level function. will take ExpressionMap (map of maps) and the threshold (min absolute corr strength as a float) and return a network. 
    -it will include (IniatializeNetwork) - which will build an empty network / empty nodes (essentially initialzie the network hehe)
    -the CorrMtx func (CreateCorrelationMatrix)
    -AssignEdges func - takes a network (slice of nodes), slice of strings geneName, the 2d array of floats corrMtx, and the float threshold, and it will connect the nodes between 2 genes with edges wherever the correlation is greater than or equal to the threshold


FOR MAIN:
8. Export Functions - these ones will be needed to be visualized with RShiny
-ex. ExportEdgesToCSV
-ex. ExportAdjacencyMtx: takes network, slice of genes, threshold, and output path, returns error (if there is one)
